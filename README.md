# ThunderWebRTCServer
ThunderWebRTCServer is a extremely scalable and fast WebRTC media server that's based on the famous open-source library Mediasoup. Our server significantly reduces the configuration &amp; deployment overhead introduces by mediasoup so that developers can focus on what matters instead of spending hours just to deploy mediasoup.
